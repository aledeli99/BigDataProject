This code aims to develop and compare machine learning models for predicting risk levels for pregnant women in Bangladesh, using data from wearable devices. 
The main objective is to provide predictive tools that can identify levels of risk to maternal health during pregnancy. 
The code includes an exploratory phase of the provided variables, data preparation, training of logistic regression models and neural networks, hyperparameter optimization and model performance evaluation.
The results obtained make it possible to compare the effectiveness of different approaches in predicting risk levels, providing useful information to improve maternal health management.
